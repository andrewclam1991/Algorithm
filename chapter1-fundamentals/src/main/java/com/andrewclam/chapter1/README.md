# Chapter 1 Fundamentals
In this chapter I get to review, practice and solidify my understanding in Java programming fundamentals:

- Section 1: Basic programming model using Java.

- Section 2: OOP data abstraction with data types, design by contract with exceptions and assertions.

This chapter module aims to organize the exercise requirements, solutions and sample use-case tests.
